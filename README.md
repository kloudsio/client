Web application launchpad built for the open-source web.
We host open-source web apps by making them available to users from a click of a button. We dont sell the open-source apps, instead, we sell the services to use them. And to be fair enough to the hard-working developers that contribute greatly to the open-source community, we pay them a substantial amount from the subscriber fee of their apps. Once users subscribe to use any app, the app author (developer) gets paid.

The apps we put on our klouds ranges from the following list below:
 - Wordpress
 - Forums
 - Blogging
 - Gogs


The tech behind out ability to pull this off replies on the followings:

  **Docker** - Containerizes Apps
  
  **Docker Compose** Containerizes Containers
  
  **Rancher** - Magic happens and apps are all but containerized!
  
  **Klouds** - Apps. (but what about cont-- shhhh!)
