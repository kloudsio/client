**Automatic Funding Mechanism for Open Source Web Applications**


We host open-source web apps by making them available to users from a click of a button. We don't sell the open-source apps, instead, we sell the the infrastructure that they run on and the systems that keep them running smoothly.  In order to increase the quality and diversity of applications available to our users, and because we think it's a neat concept, we're going where no equivalent software has gone before:  We pay the developers of the applications that we sell in the hope that we can make the choice to produce 100% open source software much easier than it is today.  We're developing a license for this portion of our code that allows reuse only in situations where the development community will earn.  None of us is sure that this is the right path, but it feels right so we're going to walk it for a while.  No one is under any obligation to take the money our application generates, and if you don't want it, please let us know where you'd like it sent (one fellow chose the EFF, we support that choice, of course!)
